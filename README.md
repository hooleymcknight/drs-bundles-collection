# Dr. Squatch Bundle Collection Take-Home Project
Holly's bundle collection page for the Dr. Squatch take-home coding project. Thanks for the opportunity to work on this! It was a fun project :)

## How to Preview:
Use Ctrl + Click to navigate [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hooleymcknight/drs-bundles-collection/blob/main/build/index.html) to preview the final result. GitHub unfortunately still doesn't open in new tab. :(

## Notes:
- The main chunk of the code is in the `src` folder. Of course the `build` folder was generated by the React scripts, but I had to include it so this was previewable.
- Sometimes the "included products" list loads in a different order. The code will always put the commas and the "and" in the right place, but the content doesn't always pull from the endpoints in the same order.
- The included products for the first bundle don't match the image, but this is what's coming from the endpoint.
